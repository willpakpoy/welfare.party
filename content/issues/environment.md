The environment is very important for the welfare party and we are acting upon major issues

We are polluting the environment. As hard as it is to accept that change is needed.

Green house gasses as well as other pollutants are affecting our environment mainly from energy production using non-renewable energy this is destroying us.

# Most prevalent air pollutants 

Smog and soot are the two biggest pollutants. This causes global warming and increases the production of allergenic air increased flooding and longer pollen seasons. 
Smog is created when fossil fuels are emitted into the air and react to sunlight and when there is more ultraviolet radiation, and this increases the amount of air pollution.

# Most hazardous air pollutants 

There are also deadlier pollutants that have more regulations but still mercury, lead, dioxins, and benzene are emitted during gas or coal combustion benzene can cause eye, lung, and skin irritation in short term and blood disorders in the long run. Dioxins can affect the liver and harm the immune system, nervous system, and reproduction functions lead can damage kidsâ€™ brains and even IQ and ability to learn. Mercury affects the central nervous system.

# What to do about this?

The welfare party is here to save the day! Our aim in the environment sector is to have a complete overhaul on energy production using renewable energy. We want to minimise the amount of gasoline we burn. We also want to restrict power providers carbon footprint and get most of our energy to be reusable only. Also using electric busses and trams is a great way to reduce this. For more details on how this is possible contact our leading environment politician and key figure at the welfare party Euan Greig.
