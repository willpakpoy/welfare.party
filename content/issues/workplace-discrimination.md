> We still have **so far to go**.

> We need to implement laws to prevent and protect against discrimination in the following fields:

- An individual being out of the workforce
- Marital status
- Australia is one of the only countries in the world which doesn't guarantee equal pay across all genders.
- Our current legislation is too vague, and has too many loopholes.

> Australia's anti-discrimination laws **have not been** consistetly amended to follow social changes.

> If our country wants to remain known as a diverse, and culturally accepting country, we **need to** amend our discrimination laws to **protect our people**.

> If our party is elected, we will implement a **mandatory zero-tolerance anti-discrimination** policy, and overhaul the system for reporting discrimination to ensure that it is simple.
